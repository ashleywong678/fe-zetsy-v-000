        Jewelry in the Americans has an ancient hsitory. Beginning as far back as 8800 BCE, Paleo-Indians in the American Southwest drilled and shaped mulicolored stones and shells into beads and pendants. Olivella shell beads, dating from 6000 BCE, were found in Nevada; bone, antler, and possibly marine shell beads from 7000 BCE were found in Russell Cave in Alabama; copper jewelry was traded from Lake Superior beginning in 3000 BCE; and stone beads were carved in Poverty Point in Louisiana in 1500 BCE. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_jewelry">Learn more.</a>
